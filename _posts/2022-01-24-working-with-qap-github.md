The QA at the Point (QAP) Knowledgebase lives within the [qa-at-the-point](https://github.com/qa-at-the-point) organization on GitHub. It consists of:

- All of the repos within the QAP GitHub org
- The main [https://base.qap.dev](https://base.qap.dev) website
- And the [base](https://github.com/qa-at-the-point/base) repo which includes:
  - The code for the main website (ie posts/articles)
  - An `Issues` tab to submit requests, bugs, etc.
  - A `Discussions` tab to ask questions, answer things, or contribute to a conversation
  - A `Wiki` tab for everything else!

This post will cover the QAP org on GitHub so you know where to go, what's included, and how you can get answers to your questions!

## Create a Free Account

Creating a GitHub account is completely free! There are paid versions, but working on Open Source (including the QAP Knowledgebase) only requires the free version.

There are many "how to" guides and videos on this topic, so I'll reference [this one from Wikihow](https://www.wikihow.com/Create-an-Account-on-GitHub) that includes screenshots along with the steps.

## QA at the Point Organization

The [github.com/qa-at-the-point](https://github.com/qa-at-the-point) homepage is a good starting place to see all that's happening and available in the knowledgebase. Each repo will have a specific purpose, but the [base repo](https://github.com/qa-at-the-point/base) is... well, the "base" of the knowledgebase.

> ðŸ’¡ You don't have to be in the QAP org to access or use the knowledgebase. It's free and public for anyone to use.

#### Get Added

With a GitHub account, you can now be added to the [github.com/qa-at-the-point](https://github.com/qa-at-the-point) org!

> ðŸ’¡ Do this if you would like to be a maintainer or contribute to the knowledgebase more frequently. Otherwise, pull requests are welcome from anyone!

In our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/qautah/shared_invite/zt-4cbb6q78-J8opsCMlPqOKdef42x9kUw) group, reach out to Carlos Kidman and send them your GitHub username to be added.

## QAP Base Repo

The "base" repo for the entire knowledgebase is this one: [github.com/qa-at-the-point/base](https://github.com/qa-at-the-point/base)

> ðŸ’¡ Most communication for the knowledgebase will happen in the base repo and in Slack.

#### Code

The codebase within the repo is used for the [base.qap.dev](https://base.qap.dev) website. If you want to add a post, refer to this post explaining how to do so: [How to make a Post](https://base.qap.dev/how-to-make-a-post)

#### Issues

The [Issues Tab](https://github.com/qa-at-the-point/base/issues) is used to create requests, bugs, etc. For example, if you would like someone from the community to add a post about `Security` or `Accessibility Testing`, create an Issue with the questions or info you're looking for.

We can track these Issues and find experts and/or testers to help create something for it. It could be a post, a wiki case study, a presentation for our monthly meetup, or a hands-on workshop for our weekly classes.

#### Discussions

The [Discussions Tab](https://github.com/qa-at-the-point/base/discussions) is used to ask questions and have conversations with the QAP community. The Discussions board behaves very similarly to StackOverflow, but would be specifically for QAP, testing, quality, etc.

Like StackOverflow, you can search discussions, mark a response as the accepted answer, vote up responses, and more! Slack is great for things like larger communications and informal conversations, but you wouldn't search Slack for previously answered questions...

#### Wiki

The [Wiki Tab](https://github.com/qa-at-the-point/base/wiki) is used as a database of files. Posts on the website are more formal and go through our CI/CD processes. They are also in a "blog post" format.

For example, if you or your company had a **Test Plan Template** that you wanted to share, it would most likely go in the Wiki. Then you could create a Post, like _"How we use Test Plans"_, which could reference your template in the wiki.

## Learning Git and GitHub

There are many great guides and videos on how to work with git and GitHub. Instead of re-inventing the wheel, I'll let the pros teach you instead! Here are some resources that are super helpful:

- [Beginner's Guide to Git and GitHub by freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-beginners-guide-to-git-github/)
- [GitHub Learning Lab by github.com](https://lab.github.com/)
- [Git Tutorial by Simon Berner on Test Automation University](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/git-tutorial/)

## Gitpod

Gitpod is an open-source Kubernetes application providing prebuilt, collaborative development environments in your browser - powered by VS Code.

> ðŸ’¡ QAP repos will be "gitpod ready".

For more info, refer to the [Gitpod Official Docs](https://www.gitpod.io/docs)
