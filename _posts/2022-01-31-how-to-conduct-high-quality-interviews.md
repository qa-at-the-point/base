## Roles and Definitions

One person can take on multiple roles or switch between them. Usually you start with the “lineup”, but do what feels natural in the interview.

#### Driver

The person “running” the interview. They do the intro, present the agenda, “give the mic” to different people, ask interview questions, and provide the outtro/next steps.

#### Interviewer

The person leading the questions and scenarios. Usually the Subject Matter Expert (SME) or person that will work most closely with the candidate if hired. It is up to the Interviewer to decide which questions and scenarios to use and which to skip while keeping things flexible if “tangents” or follow-up questions are valuable. Also, allow the Driver or Support to ask follow ups as well.

#### Support

The person that “keeps the flow moving smoothly”. Keep everyone on topic, make sure we are time-boxing things appropriately, ask interview questions, etc. It’s easy for the Interviewer to dive deep into tangents or follow up questions, so make sure we manage our time for other pieces, like giving the candidate 5-10 minutes at the end to ask their questions.

#### Candidate

Aka the interviewee. They should be made to feel comfortable and welcome at all times. We want them leaving the interview with a positive experience, even if we say no.


✏️ Happy writing and have a quality day ✏️
